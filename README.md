## 📦 What's Included

- Example 1: **Lego Brick Detection** (multi-class bounding boxes and tracking of LegoBricks)
- Example 2: **Card Sorting** (multi-class oriented bounding boxes card classification)
- 🛠 Data pipeline scripts to load labeled Unity exports
- 📁 Predefined dataset format compatible with Ultralytics
- 📄 Training scripts for YOLOv11
